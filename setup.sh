# Check that git directory is there

# Check if .bashrc, .vimrc, .taskrc, .task or any other files in dotfiles repo are in home directory

# If yes to both, complete a diff on the two files

# Check with user to see if they are okay with the changes between original and new from dotfiles repo

# If okay, delete old files. Or just move/archive them.

# Then symlink new files

# For Taskwarrior, install taskwarrior
  # This could be a separate file
  # Each file could be separate script
